## Overview

Hurricanes are among the most destructive natural disasters, and accurate forecasting can save lives and reduce economic losses. This project performs a detailed descriptive analysis of the historical hurricane forecasting data to:
- Understand trends over time.
- Evaluate prediction accuracy using various metrics.
- Visualize relationships between different predictors and hurricane intensities.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a CSV file (`datasetfinale.csv`) and includes:
- **Years**: Historical time span of data (e.g., 1981â€“2022).
- **Predictors**: Features like time series values, lagged months, and climate indices.
- **Targets**: Observed hurricane activity metrics.

---

## Analysis Steps

The descriptive analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Loading Data**: Importing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing or inconsistent values.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating measures like mean, median, variance, and correlations.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Evaluating trends and seasonal patterns in the data.
5. **Visualization**: Plotting key metrics to understand relationships and outliers.
